<h1>The Best Movies According to Kirk</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Akira</h3>
<p>This anime movie is God tier. A must watch.</p>
<h3>SuperBad</h3>
<p>This movie is freaking hilarious. An instant classic with enough qoutable moments to replace your lack of personality.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first in the trilogy will always outshine the others.</p>
